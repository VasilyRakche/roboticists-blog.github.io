      <description>Rough calculations for required characteristics Brushless motor calculation forum thread
Motors to buy Several criterias to have in mind; in no particular order:
 Pancake shape (bigger diameter, thinner case) - more torque Smaller weight/size Smaller KV (more torque/less speed) Bigger number of poles (more torque) Price Overall power Max current and rated voltage Build quality  Narrow choice motors Maytech Maytech 8626 100kv 86x26,5mm 250g
T-Motor T-Motor Antigravity 5008 KV170 270mOm 6s 128g 24N28P 55.</description>

      <description>Slew-rate Control From texas instruments  
Slew-rate means the slope of the VDS for the mosfet  
Driver for mosfet control Capacitors R3 based on (val wasnt mentioned)8.3.1.2.1 Serial Peropheral Interface
R4 based on Figure 34 (val wasnt mentioned)
C6 (X5R or X7R, 1-μF, 16-V ceramic capacitor) and C5 (X5R or X7R, 47-nF, VM-rated ceramic capacitor) based on 8.3.1.3 Gate Driver Voltage Supplies
C6 suggested to be split in two CVM1(X5R or X7R, 0.</description>

      <description>Cautions  Power supply must be able to sink-in current, if cant must design Shunt Regulators Pre-charge circuit must be used, more intuition about it: How the pre-charge works, some intuituion Do not connect ground pins of the CAN connector between Motor Drives Isolation of grounds is desired between the computer and Controller. In case of controll with TTY, possible solution: CAN Board Connecting MCUs to CAN Some internal settings in Firmware are calculated on Power-on.</description>

      <description>STM32F446re hardware design choices Example from Nucle64 Development board design from STM:
 
Another Example from STM32 series Evaluation board (Two capacitors for decoupling smaller C21 and the One which is selected with white outline):  
In these schematics the closer is the bigger capacitor, however, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make much difference since both of them are not that close to the board. Recommendation is to place the smallest one as close as possible to the PCB as suggested by Analog application note</description>

      <description>Suggestions on placing the MOSFETs to prevent ringing LT Spice circuit simulation for begginers
General guideliness Based on the Eric Bogatin on Breaking Bad Habits in PCB Design.Some additional details in his article Signal trace width - 6 mil (1 Amp max) Power traces - 20 mil (3 Amp max) Drilled diameter for signal traces - 13 mil - narrow via to get higher interconnectency If one must route something on bottom layer, make path short and use bridges (return strap) as on the picture:   Algorighm for choosing the capacitance is to flat out the previous circuit impedance (as looking from the end- Microcontroller for example) to the beggingin (Voltage source)   In particular, when chosing capcitance, try to flat out the peak from the previous capacitance in the circuit:   Initial resons for having several capacitance:</description>
